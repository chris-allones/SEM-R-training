- Objectives of factor analysis
- Designing an EFA
- Assumptions in EFA
- Deriving factors and assessing overall fit
- Interpreting factor

### [Session 2: CFA and SEM](https://chris-allones.github.io/trainings/SEM_presentation/02_cfa_sem/cfa_sem_presentation.html)
#### Topics
- CFA-SEM overview
- CFA-SEM with Lavaan package
- Defining constructs
- Developing the overall measurement model

- Specifying the structural model
- Assessing the structural model validity

### [Session 3: Case study](https://chris-allones.github.io/trainings/SEM_presentation/03_case_study/03_case_study.html)

In this session, we will be replicating the results of a study entitled "Young people's perceived service quality and environmental performance of hybrid electric bus service" by Munim and Noor (2020). You can access the article by clicking this [DOI link](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tbs.2020.03.003). The idea of this session is to be familiar with how SEM results are presented in a publishable format.
